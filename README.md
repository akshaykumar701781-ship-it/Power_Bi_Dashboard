## 📘 About This Project  

In this project, I created an **Employee Insight Dashboard** using **Power BI**, where I analyzed HR data to explore:  
- Total employees and attrition rate  
- Attrition by education, age group, and job role  
- Years at company and salary levels  
- Key influencers affecting attrition  

This dashboard helps visualize critical metrics that drive HR decision-making and provides a clear overview of workforce trends.
